# Twittodex

## Principles

The Twittodex posts every twelve hours a serie of tweets about a Pok√©mon's informations, stats and weakness. You can check his account just [here](https://twitter.com/TwittodexBot).
You can find about stats, weaknesses and general informations about the Pokemon of the day.

## Additional informations

The Twittodex was hosted by [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) in order to test.
I am soon going to host it on a small raspberry pi and run the program with a service or with cron.
